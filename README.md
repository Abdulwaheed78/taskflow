Setup MySQL Database

Create a database, e.g., carecomp_tasks.

Import the tasks.sql file (contains the tasks table structure).

Update database credentials in db.php.

<?php
$con = mysqli_connect("localhost", "username", "password", "carecomp_tasks");
if (!$con) die("Database connection failed: " . mysqli_connect_error());
?>


Run the application

Place files in your local server folder (htdocs for XAMPP, www for WAMP).

Access via browser: http://localhost/carecomp-tasks/.

Database Schema

tasks table structure:

Column	Type	Description
id	INT PK AUTO	Unique task ID
title	VARCHAR(255)	Task title
website	VARCHAR(100)	Associated website
priority	ENUM	Task priority: High, Medium, Low
status	ENUM	Task status: pending, completed
created_at	TIMESTAMP	Task creation timestamp

You can also seed the database with random tasks for testing (e.g., 20,000 tasks).

Usage

Add a Task: Enter a task title, website, and select priority → press Enter.

Edit Task: Click on the title, website, status, or priority fields → modify → press Enter or change select value.

Delete Task: Click the trash icon to remove a task.

Search/Filter:

Type in the search box to filter by title.

Use dropdowns to filter by status, priority, or website.

Pagination:

Use < or > buttons to navigate pages.

Enter a page number and click “Go” to jump directly to a page.

Hover Details: Hover over the title input to view task details in a tooltip-like card.

Styling

Tasks are highlighted based on priority:

High → Red border

Medium → Yellow border

Low → Green border

Tables and summary cards have a transparent design with hover effects.

Buttons and inputs are rounded for modern UI.

Known Issues / Notes

Pagination is limited to “Previous/Next” and Go-to-page input to handle large datasets efficiently.

Search works with title filtering; ensure that AJAX requests include the search query.
